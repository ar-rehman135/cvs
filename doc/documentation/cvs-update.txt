.main()
	The main driver function which reads cache and create index 
	file if it does not exist and call several functions to add 
	data into cache. 

.static int verify_path(char *path)
	Takes a filename and checks if there is any ambigous 
	character in it.

.static int add_file_to_cache(char *path) 
	Populates the structs according to that file meta data and 
	calls index_fd and add_cache_entry to add file in cache. 

.static int index_fd(const char * path, int namelen, struct cache_entry *ce, 
			int fd, struct stat *st)

	It compresses the contents of original file, generates SHA file and 
	write compressed content into that file. 

.static int add_cache_entry(struct cache_entry *ce)
	Recieves a cache_entry struct of a file and add it to 
	cache. 

.static int remove_file_from_cache(char *path)
	Removes a file from cache if it has been removed from working copy. 

.static int cache_name_compare(const char *name1, int len1, const char *name2, int len2)
	Compares the names of the files on the basis of their lengths.

.static int cache_name_pos(const char *name, int namelen)
	Determines the position where the new entry must be added into our cache. 

.static int write_cache(int fd, struct cache_entry **cache, int entries)
	Writes all the data present in active_cache array into our index file.
